<!-- 10/10 -->
# 1 How can *individuals* do *significantly more* each day? (10/10)

<!-- 10/10 -->
## 1.1 We are confined to our desks and chairs while working. (10/10)

Human beings didn't evolve to sit in chairs. We evolved to walk around. When a human being sits in a chair all day, he gets unnecessarily fatigued and hence can't get as much done as he otherwise would.

<!-- 10/10 -->
### 1.1.1 Editing text (among other things) on a mobile device is slow and cumbersome. (10/10)

Mobile devices have so many problems that make them inefficient for editing text: (i) typing speeds are low (~40wpm vs. ~100wpm), (ii) visual real estate is low, (iii) cursor manipulation is cumbersome, and last but not least: it's physically tiring to have to hold the device up to your eyes for longer than 10 minutes straight.

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 1.1.2 Smartphones and computers don't adequately sync. (8/10)

The dream is that somebody could activate some syncing configuration whereby workflows are perfectly synced between all devices (down to the level of cursor position).

**(Predicted) Solution:** Right now, smartphones are distinct from computers.  I predict that this won't always be the case: in the future, smartphones will *become* our (dockable) computers.  This way, the problem of "perfect syncing" will be achieved as a byproduct.  

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 1.1.3 Multi-tasking on smartphones is hard. (8/10)

Switching between apps and managing tabs is a painful experience in a smart phone. It’s one of the many reasons why mobile phones are vastly inferior to desktops and laptops when it comes to getting real work done (the other major issues are inferior typing and smaller screen real estate).

**Question:** What would happen if somebody were to carry around 3 smartphones, all connected to the internet, and all connected to each other?

<!-- 6.5/10 -->
### 1.1.4 Changing between workspaces is slow and cumbersome. (6.5/10)

Even when all we want to do is switch between two stationary work locations, it is painful. This is because we have to do one of two things: (i) physically carry our computers with us from one location to another, or (ii) log into a *new* computer with a completely foreign configuration.

<!-- 8/10 -->
## 1.2 It is hard to stay aware of, manage, and plan for our fluctuating energy levels throughout the day. (8/10)

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 1.2.1 We lack hard, personalized data on how certain activities impact our energy level. (8/10)
How does running impact our energy levels (quantitatively)? What about sprint planning? Going to a movie? Etc. Having hard data on this would be invaluable.

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 1.2.2 When planning, we lack awareness of how our energy levels will fluctuate. (8/10)

Our energy fluctuates across many different scales: from minute-to-minute, day-to-day, and even from week-to-week and month-to-month. Getting a grip on how our energy flows would be immensely valuable when planning on scheduling.

<!-- 9/10 -->
## 1.3 We don't learn *fast enough*. (9/10)

**Question:** How can make it so that the average high-performer can consume 1 book a day?

<!-- 9/10 -->
### 1.3.1 Reading dense content with our current tools is too hard. (9/10)
- It's easy to lose your place (i.e., complex content makes reaching stopping harder).
- Reading hard material should be more single-tasked (i.e., one sentence at a time).

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 1.3.2 The selection of audiobooks (+audio content) is way too limited. (8/10)

Yet audiobooks are amazing because (i) they free you from your desk and chair, and (ii) they allow you to effectively multi-task when you're out running errands. Expanding the selection of audiobooks to technical content, internet articles, and so forth is a problem that needs solving.

<!-- 9/10 -->
## 1.4 We can't write and communicate *fast (and clearly) enough*. (9/10)

**Question:** How can we make it so that the average high-performance writer can generate 10,000 high-quality words per day?

<!-- 9/10 -->
### 1.4.1 Writing is a difficult, painful process that frequently acts as a bottleneck for lots of communication and idea storage. (9/10)

- People don't ask questions because they don't want to write.
- People don't provide feedback because they don't want to write.
- People procrastinate on their work because they don't want to write.
- People don't codify their ideas into storage because they don't want to write.

Are there ways to make the process of writing 10x easier?

<!-- 7/10 -->
### 1.4.2 Ubiquitous capture is difficult. (7/10)
In New York, I tend to take notes on whiteboards, with pictures, in the “Notes” app, and so forth. In other words, notes are coming in from many different channels. What sucks is that when I’m processing these notes later on, I have to remember to check each of these different sources. That is quite painful, and causes me to stop processing notes when I otherwise should. What *should* happen is that all of my notes naturally channel into a single universal feed, but I'm not sure of anything currently out there that makes this possible.

<!-- 7.5/10 -->
## 1.4.3 Email sucks. (7.5/10)

See the nMail thread. I suppose I'm still into this if we can think of a 10x improvement product over email.

<!-- 9/10 -->
## 1.5 Gaining access to high-quality knowledge and feedback is still too hard. (9/10)

<!-- 6.5/10 -->
### 1.5.1 We have a systematic bias against giving and receiving feedback, and this causes us to waste years of our life on stupid ideas. (6.5/10)

As a result, it's hard (i.e.) for entrepreneurs and businesses to validate ideas, for lawyers to validate arguments, for teachers to validate teaching methods, and on and on.

Still, this strikes me more of a discipline/behavior issue than a problem that is stemming from having the right tools. That's why I don't include as something we should really be focusing on that much (even though this problem is *deeply* important to me on a personal level).

<!-- 8.5/10 -->
### 1.5.2 Getting access to high-quality information (via crowdsourcing) reliably and speedily is still challenging. (8.5/10)

That is, crowdsourcing is hit or miss along the dimensions of speed, reliability, and quality. To make matters worse, you don't even always get what you pay for (sometimes the free information is the best, and sometimes the paid information is the worst).

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 1.5.3 The process of crowdsourcing involves painful emailing, writing, and social lubricating. (8/10)
- Asking questions to old acquaintances can open up a can of worms ("Hey George!! Long time no see, how are you??").
- Asking for help on forums often involves painful writing about your problem's context that would otherwise be easy to describe (or contextually understood) in plainspoken conversation.

<!-- 9/10 -->
### 1.5.4 Knowing what the most up to date research says on any particular topic is unreasonably hard. (9/10)

There is SO much good information out there in the form of academic research; yet this research is held up in the protected fortress of academic obscurity, and so is often hard for us to access. Something tells me that even FancyHands would suck at getting academic information (we might want to test for this though).

I'm not sure how big the market for this sort of product would be, nor how good current market solutions already are, but I would be interested in running some tests if the costs to us were low enough.

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 1.5.5 None of us *really know* how other people (i.e., employees, employers, job-seekers, ballers, and so forth) spend their time, yet this information would be very useful for a lot of different parties to know. (8/10)

<!-- 6/10 -->
## 1.6 Body maintenance is time-consuming and requires long-term discipline. (6/10)

A lot of these problems are extremely important yet, as we discussed over the phone, will probably involve a bunch of biology and things outside of our immediate expertise.

<!-- 6/10  -->
### 1.6.1 Sleeping/waking up is difficult. (6/10)

<!-- 5/10  -->
### 1.6.2 Staying on an exercise regimen is difficult. (5/10)

<!-- 6/10  -->
### 1.6.3 Eating clean is difficult. (6/10)

<!-- 6/10 -->
### 1.6.4 Our postures suck. (6/10)

Looking forward to trying out the [Lumo](http://www.lumobodytech.com) at some point in the future.

<!-- 7/10 -->
### 1.6.5 It is painful for people to acquire key health metrics. (7/10)

This is an interesting problem, but I'm worried it's too human-nature-upstream to be a billion dollar business.

# 2 Assorted Social Problems. (7/10)

The following are a list of social problems that I admit are (very, very) important for humanity. They don't, however, tend to make the top of my list, nor can they be organized as a subset of a central, overarching problem as per above.

<!-- 7.99/10 -->
## 2.1 We age, we lose our minds, and then die. (7.99/10)
EXTREMELY important, yet outside of my domain.

<!-- 7.99/10 -->
## 2.2 We need to colonize space. (7.99/10)
EXTREMELY important, yet outside of my domain (+I'm too much of a pussy to send myself into space).

<!-- 7.99/10 -->
## 2.3 Our neurology addicts us to irrational behavior. (7.99/10)
EXTREMELY important, yet outside of my domain.

### 2.3.1 Americans are too fat. (7.99/10)

This has probably the single biggest impact of anything on the list.

<!-- 8/10 -->
## 2.4 How can authors better monetize their content? (8/10)

What they provide to the world is so valuable. How can we help them better monetize their content? Books as a Service? Something else?

<!-- 5/10 -->
## 2.5 Our education system is horrible. (5/10)

<!-- 5/10 -->
## 2.6 People waste their lives playing video games. (5/10)

[Except for Elon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB11M7fXDd4#t=133)

<!-- 7/10 -->
## 2.7 Dealing with people sucks. (7/10)

<!-- 8/10 -->
### 2.7.1 Everybody should be able to work from home (if they want to). (8/10)

The freedom to be able to work from home -- if somebody wants -- seems like a really good thing to me. Working for yourself breeds independence, lowers stress, lowers bullshit, and so forth. You start to realize that all people care about are your results, and if you have that those people don't give a shit what you do or where you are.

**Question:** Are there any technological advancements we can think of which would help grow the remote worker economy?

## 2.8 Click bait media is ruining our society (+people's lives). (5/10)
This also is a very bad problem affecting us; unfortunately, I'm not interested enough in it for it to make the list.

<!-- 6/10 -->
## 2.9 In America, women act like men, and men act like women. (7.99/10)

Hard problem this is. I think I might tackle this later on my life through writing (after I'm rich). I'm not sure I've even fleshed out my ideas fully on this topic (at least not rigorously enough for me to start "solving" it).

<!--## 1.3 Effectively multitasking is difficult. -->

<!-- The costs of context switching are steep (so we should avoid it as much as we can), yet context switching is still an inevitable feature of modern living. -->
